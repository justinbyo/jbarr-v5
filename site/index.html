            <p>
                I specialize in turning complex domains (like cybersecurity and web hosting)<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> into user-friendly, strategically-impactful, and scalable experiences for startups and enterprise companies alike. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, I&rsquo;m a Product Manager at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, where I lead teams maintaining and scaling its UI platform, including the navigation,<sup><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> accessibility, and its design system <a href="https://primer.style">Primer</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                Before that, I was a product and design leader at <a href="http://signalsciences.com" title="Signal Sciences homepage">Signal Sciences</a>,
                a cybersecurity startup acquired by <a href="https://fastly.com">Fastly</a> in 2020.<sup><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> I led development of the UI dashboard, designed identity and access management features, guided privacy and data governance initiatives, and created a new self-service tier and sales motion.
                <br>
                <br>
                I&rsquo;ve worked across product, design, and engineering at a variety of companies such as <a href="https://godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> and <a href="https://carbonfive.com">Carbon Five</a>.
                I&rsquo;ve also written, mentored, and presented on Agile product development, rapid prototyping, and growing careers in tech.
